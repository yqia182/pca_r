## Preliminary conclusions
  For each ferment group, triplicates were tightly clustered together, implying good reproducibility. 
  JN group samples were more spread out compared to the other three medium groups, suggesting that the inoculation treatments in the JN medium were more variable in their aroma production than other medium groups. 
  Uninoculated ferments in the SS and JS groups went through spontaneous fermentation to a certain extent, resulting in aroma chemistry profiles that were slightly closer to their respective inoculated on the PCA.
